         <h2>About Us</h2>
        
        <p>  Leah's Lettuce and Fungi is small scale farm started in 2018, but fully incorporated and established as a farm officially in 2024.  We run two greenhouses, about 1 acre of grow space.</p>
            
            <p> On the banks of Dotter's Creek, a wild A trout stream in the Southern Poconos, we practice sustainable agriculture through natural composting, seed saving, no till, and feeding the soil with natural fertilizers ispired by Jadam.  The farm requires minimal inputs through seed saving, local sourced compost, and no mechanized equipment except a chainsaw. The major inputs are primarly labor through hand seeding, hand weeding, and old fashioned harvesting.  The pest and weed management on this 1 acre grow space is entirely natural.  There is absolutely zero synthetic pesticides or herbicides on the premises.</p>
            
            <p> The head grower Jake Atherly is an industry trained chemist, microbiologist, and a full time teacher at Tamaqua Area High School as well as an adjunct at LCCC.  He is nearing completion of a master's degree in analytical chemsitry.  His passions for growing stem from very early childhood where he was constantly surrounded by food and ag, whether that was foraging for morel mushrooms with his dad, or helping stake and tie tomatoes with his late grandfather. </p>   
            
            <p>All that being said the vegetable gardening and mycological operations are approached from the scientific perspective where conditions of the soil both chemically and biologically are closely monitored to produce artisanal and a focused product line.  We specialize in organic Romaine lettuce, buttercrunch (Boston) lettuce, Brandywine heirloom tomatoes, Muncher and Marketmore cucumbers and the most prized product the shiitake mushrooms.  We grow a little bit of everying but overtime have focused our efforts on a few choice culinary treats.  We work with local food districts and will go toe to toe with distributors in the restaurant space.  If we can't beat their price, we'll be the taste of their product everytime.  We are looking forward to making some more proper fitting restaurant partners.</p> 
            
            <p>The administrative lead and head harvester is Jake's wife Annie.  And of course the owner, and CEO Leah.  We look forward to doing business with you...   </p>
